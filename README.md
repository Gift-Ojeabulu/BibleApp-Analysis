# streamlit-bible-app
I built a bible app with streamlit deployed on heroku that has features like part of speech bible text tag, counts of word and graphs of word count.

    ```bash
    pip install requirements.txt
    ```
2. Run the demo:

    ```
3. View the Streamlit app in your browser: `http://localhost:8501`
